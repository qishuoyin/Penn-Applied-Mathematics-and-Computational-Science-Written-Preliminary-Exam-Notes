# Penn-Applied-Mathematics-and-Computational-Science-Written-Preliminary-Exam-Notes
This repository aims to help incoming students better prepare for the written preliminary exams for Ph.D. and master's in Applied Mathematics and Computational Science at the University of Pennsylvania. You will find my review notes for the covered material of the exams and my solution draft for some of the previous years' exams. Notice that my notes do not cover every detail of the topic list on the AMCS official website, but I choose to emphasize some crucial definitions and tricks from my experience. In addition, some solution drafts only contain my idea for the question because I think the solution will be trivial when you have the idea as a hint. Good luck with your examsÔºÅ
